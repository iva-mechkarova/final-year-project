# About 

The goal of this project is to devise an engaging and intuitive video game targeted at children living in Ireland, with the purpose of gathering data on how they spell. 

# Details 

An intuitive and engaging game is an ideal method for gathering data from a large set of children. Throughout the game, the children will be prompted to spell a variety of words. In cases where the spelling varies greatly from the given word, they will be encouraged to use a "sound-it-out" method - hence the title, "Sound-It-Out Spell-Checking Game". We are interested in gathering this data as it will be used to better the accuracy of S-Capade: Spelling Correction Aimed at Particular Deviant Errors, which is a phonemic-based spellchecker aimed at correcting misspellings made by children. Throughout the development of the game, ethics must be accounted for as ethics permission would be required before the game is deployed with children.
